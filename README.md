ProvPlug: A LLM-Driven Plugin Framework for Bridging Provenance Graph Host Intrusion Detection Systems and Graph Neural Networks
```


## Introduction

ProvPlug is a LLM-driven plugin framework for bridging Provenance Graph Host Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It combines the general capabiblities of LLMs learned from open-source enviroments with domain-specific knowledge of Data Provenance Graphs (DPGs) to enhance the detection performance of PIDSs.
